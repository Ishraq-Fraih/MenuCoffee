🛒 MenuCoffee – Java-Based Café Ordering System
🚀 Project Overview:
MenuCoffee is a Java-based café ordering system that allows users to browse and order from a menu of Cold Drinks, Hot Drinks, Sweets, and Bakery items. The system is built using GeneralTree structure to organize menu categories and employs user input handling for an interactive ordering experience.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Tree-Based Menu Structure – Uses a GeneralTree to categorize menu items.
✅ Interactive User Input – Customers can select items, view prices, and confirm orders.
✅ Order Management – Supports multiple orders and handles user responses dynamically.
✅ Formatted Console Output – Displays an organized menu for easy navigation.

🔧 Technologies Used:

Java (Core Java, OOP Principles)
GeneralTree Data Structure
Scanner for User Input Handling
🎯 Future Enhancements:
🔹 GUI Implementation – Convert console-based system to a JavaFX or Swing interface.
🔹 Database Integration – Store orders and menu data persistently.
🔹 Multiple Payment Options – Simulate online payment methods.
